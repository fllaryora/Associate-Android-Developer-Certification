#### Fundamental Application Components
>Understanding of Android's top-level application components ([Activity](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWy8DQlwJkdw5GZHEj4ZhR4cayR-ou6Hh), [Service](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWy8DQlwJkdzW-dHvL1py-vyF6vYEmDmw), [Broadcast Receiver](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWy8DQlwJkdwtBDTpP3tsjx0wXhR2shOq), [Content Provider](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWy8DQlwJkdy2_bBHMQgGyrN4784K3Go0)) and the lifecycle associated with each one. Candidates should be able to describe the types of application logic that would be best suited for each component, and whether that component is executing in the foreground or in the background. This includes strategies for determining how and when to execute background work.
- [ ] Describe an application's key functional and nonfunctional requirements
- [ ] Create an Activity that displays a layout resource
- [ ] [Schedule a time-sensitive task using alarms](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-jobdispatcher-android)

- [ ] Integrate code from an external support library
  - [ ] [[Udacity Course] Advanced Android App Development Lesson: Libraries](https://www.udacity.com/course/advanced-android-app-development--ud855)

#### Persistent Data Storage
>Determining appropriate use cases for local [persisted data](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWy8DQlwJkdzafwjoVUcx9283oIbJQvFC), and designing solutions to implement data storage using files, preferences, and databases. This includes implementing strategies for bundling static data with applications, caching data from remote sources, and managing user-generated private data. Candidates should also be able to describe platform features that allow applications to store data securely and share that data with other applications in a secure manner.

- [ ] Define a database schema; include tables, fields, and indices
  - [ ] [[Udacity Course]  Data Storage][db_udacity]
- [ ] Create an application-private database file
- [ ] Construct database queries returning single results

  - [ ] [[Udacity Course] Developing Android Apps Lesson: Preferences](https://www.udacity.com/course/new-android-fundamentals--ud851)
#### Enhanced System Integration
>Extending applications to integrate with interfaces outside the core application experience through notifications and app widgets. This includes displaying information to the user through these elements and keeping that information up to date. Candidates should also understand how to provide proper navigation from these external interfaces into the application's main task, including appropriate handling of deep links.

- [ ] Create an app widget that displays on the device home screen
